# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2022 written in Python.

## How to use this repo:

To create a day run `create_day-py`, followed by the day you want to create. If left empty, today's day will be created.

To run a day, run `run.py`, followed by a space-separated list of integers for the days you want to run. If left empty, it will run all days it can find.
